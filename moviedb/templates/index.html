<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Movie data (on 860 movies) was pulled from <a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database (TMDB)</a>. Reviewers were generated using <a href="http://listofrandomnames.com/">List of Random Names</a>. All ratings are based around the real user rating for each movie (as given by TMDB). In some cases there was no rating in which cases ratings defaulted to 0. All ratings are (re)generated when the application starts.</p>
<p>All data (except for the movie poster images which are stored on TMDB's servers) is stored in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a> database. A <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> <a href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">uWSGI</a> application running behind <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a> serves as a Web Frontend to the data. This application written entirely from scratch, uses custom templates and url mapping system to serve dynamic content to the end user.
<p>The interface is fully <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">Progressive</a>. This means that the website can be viewed on older or more restricive browsers and still work. The site will use features of the browser if present to enhance the experience (Use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>.) Supports all major browsers (only IE8+. Please, let old IEs die a peaceful death.) Finally, the site scales down on mobile web browsers without sacrificing the content.</p>
<p>All code is given to the Public Domain where possible. TMDB data belongs to that organization.</p>
